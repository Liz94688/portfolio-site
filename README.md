# User-Centric Frontend Development Project - Portfolio Site

Please find a demo of the website [here](https://liz94688.github.io/portfolio-site/)

I wanted to use my first project on the course to introduce myself, along with my newly acquired skills and knowledge in software development, to any future employers.

As such, it seemed practical to create a website to explain my current status as software-developer-in-training and to showcase my continued learning progression throughout my current course with Code Institute. 

With this being my first project, I was aware there would not be a large amount of content (i.e. projects or collaborations) to include at this time. 

However, as I progress throughout the course, I intend to update the website with any new material or information - particularly in relation to the skills I learn and (hopefully) master surrounding the different technologies included in the course.

I also included an image and colour-scheme on the website links closely to my personality. Four main colours were used throughout the website, to provide familiarity and maintain the simplistic design.

## UX

Visitors to the site would be future employers or recruiters. These users would be interested in who I was, along with the skills I had. In addition to this they would need a means of contacting me, if necessary. 

Based on this criteria, and to target my optimum audience, I decided it would be prudent to include an introduction page, a skills page and a contact page in my website. 

I made the website as clear and streamline as I could, in order to give user the most productive and enjoyable experience.

### Design ideas included:
- a layout used over the 3 main pages, giving familiarity to the user as they navigated the website
- a navigation bar which targeted each of the 3 relevant pages
- colour-coded backgrounds attached to each page, as well as the relevant navigation field associated with that page, allowing users to quickly identify what page they were currently on
- elements like timelines and progress bars placed alongside paragraphs of text, to provide interest to users and display relevant information in a creative manner
- option to download a PDF of my current CV, if needed


### Wireframes
Below is a link to the wireframes completed for the project:
[Wireframe](https://github.com/Liz94688/portfolio-site/blob/master/assets/wireframes/portfolio-site.pdf)

### Features

#### Home Page
The  page gives a brief explanation of who I am and what my ambitions are, as well as a short timeline looking at what I have achieved since learning about Code Institute back in January 2019. I plan to update this as I journey through the course

#### Skills Page
The skills page includes an explanation to any user visiting the website that I am in the process of learning a number of new technologies. I have also included a breakdown of each technology, as well as a rough estimation of how I am progressing in each field.  

As I continue with the course, I will update these progress bars to reflect where I believe myself to be.

#### Contact Page
The contact page includes any relevant information a user may need to contact me - including mobile number, email and location. 

I have also included a separate section on ‘Future Projects’ that will allow users to contact me via a contact form, if they wish to speak to me about any project ideas or collaborations in the future.

#### Downloadable CV
Finally, I have placed a link to a PDF copy of my current CV - for any future employers who require a hard copy document.

### Features Left to Implement
I plan to update the timeline and progress bars as I continue through my current course.

In the future, I would like to collapse the navigation bar when the user is on a mobile phone and place it in the top right-hand corner of the site, freeing up space for the main pages and streamlining the website, adding to the user experience.

I want to include some social media links to my personal LinkedIn, once this has been updated. This will provide further information to a user about my previous work history and current role.

Once I start creating completing further projects I plan to introduce a fourth page to the website to showcase these to any visitors.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap (4.3)

## Testing
I have completed tests on the website to confirm the internal links used by visitors work correctly and take the user to the appropriate area. 

Tests were completed on the contact form to make sure the correct areas were working. Tests demonstrated the user could not proceed without filling in the ‘Name’ and ‘Email’ area and without proving a valid email address.

I continuously used DevTools - found in Google Chrome - to test the page loads, layout, responsiveness, Javascript and CSS code.

## Deployment
The website has been published using Github Pages technology and you can find a version of this here. The publishing has been done by using the Master Branch as the source.

## Credits
All content in the ‘Home' section, as well as explanatory paragraphs in the ‘Skills’ and ‘Contact’ section, we written by me.

**Acknowledgements**
- Code Institute - I used the basic HTML structure from the mini project as a starting point. Specifically, I was influenced by the HTML code for the navigation bar and the contact information section
- Bootstrap - for the initial structure for the progress bars and contact form. I styled these in CSS afterwards
- W3Schools - after finding instructions in w3schools ‘How to’ section on how to create a timeline, I used the CSS code included in the example as a starting point in styling the code, before making relevant changes to better suit my theme and structure.
